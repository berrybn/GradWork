# Orthogonal term purpose
 1. We use ==orthogonal== for vectors in 3-space to encapsulate the idea of the fact that the inner product = 0. It is not exclusively perpendicular though. The cross section with perpendicular is as follows: #VA
	 1. We know that $\cos \theta=0$ when $\theta = \dfrac{\pi}{2}$ or $90\degree$ -> perpendicular
	 2. ![[Inner Product]]
	 3. When the inner product is 0, it would mean that the angle between the vectors = $90 \degree$, yes.
	 4. BUT ALSO when the inner product is 0, it means: $$\vec a \cdot \vec b =a_1b_1+a_2b_2+a_3b_3=0$$
# Parametric Equation variable choice
 - We use vectors to describe the position of an object in space and the subsequent forces acting on that object.
 - We are using the parameter $s$ to denote arc length as displacement. Yet another parameter we could consider is time, $t$
