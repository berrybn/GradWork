Initial synopsis: Boss of a job pinned everything on Jake, and Jake goes to jail. He chooses solitary confinement and is placed between two guys - a chess master and a master con artist. He learns all their secrets. They learn his. They make a plan to escape and tell Jake he is included. But, then they break out of jail like they were never there, leaving Jake behind. Jake gets out of jail 2 years later. He discovers he has been robbed - presumably by the two guys that he was in jail with, as they knew everything about him. Since he was flat broke and missing 7 years of his life, he decided to take revenge on the one person he could - Macha.   
Base storyline: Revenge
Confusion, and seemingly clairvoyant help from strangers

When trying to learn a new thing, it is helpful to recap what you know, especially when you are frustrated about the new stuff. The time it takes to understand something by yourself should be held up against any expectations of immediate understanding. Temper your expectations and find comfort in the grace you give yourself by proving to yourself what you do know in relation to the topic. Use it as motivation to continue trying to learn the topic. Fail is where you give up.
