Initial synopsis: Boss of a job pinned everything on Jake, and Jake goes to jail. He chooses solitary confinement and is placed between two guys - a chess master and a master con artist. He learns all their secrets. They learn his. They make a plan to escape and tell Jake he is included. But, then they break out of jail like they were never there, leaving Jake behind. Jake gets out of jail 2 years later. He discovers he has been robbed - presumably by the two guys that he was in jail with, as they knew everything about him. Since he was flat broke and missing 7 years of his life, he decided to take revenge on the one person he could - Macha.   
Base storyline: Revenge
Confusion, and seemingly clairvoyant help from strangers
