	- [x] Creating mesh 1 âœ… 2024-05-24
		main takeaway: Fill the triangulation with a single cell for a square domain. The triangulation is the refined 4 times, to yield $4^4=256$ cells in total:
		`GridGenerator::hyper_cube(triangulation);
		`triangulation.refine_global(4);
	- [x] creating mesh 2 âœ… 2024-05-24
		main takeaway: quadrilaterals are only used in Dealii. Refinement towards inner radius was created using a custom function someone made and we just call, refinement over active cells

	- [x] [[degrees of freedom]] âœ… 2024-05-30
		main takeaway: degrees of freedom are found by enumerating the mesh nodes or later, enumerating the shape functions associated with the edges, faces, or cell interiors of the mesh
		- The enumerated degrees of freedom, however, are an entirely separate thing from the indices that we will use to number the vertices of the mesh.
		- answers "how many DoF are there, globally?"
	- [x] [[shape functions]] âœ… 2024-05-30
		main takeaway: the shape function is the function which interpolates the solution between the discrete values obtained at the mesh nodes. ==We will use the [[Legendre Polynomials]] for our shape function, moving forward.== 
		- [x] [[monomial basis]] âœ… 2024-05-30
	- [x] [[sparsity]]  âœ… 2024-06-10
		main takeaway: sparsity happens by construction, and we take advantage of that so we can solve larger systems of equation
